# E-commerce Website Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an end-to-end full-stack e-commerce website using the React frontend library and the Spring Boot framework for the backend. 
The primary focus is on implementing a responsive and dynamic user interface using technologies like `react-router`, `hooks`, `axios`, `media-queries`, and `bootstrap`. 
On the server-side, we are building RESTful APIs following the MVC architecture, using `JPA` for database interaction, and leveraging automatic dependency injection.
